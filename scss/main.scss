// 1. Settings - used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
@import "settings/font-faces";
@import "settings/breakpoints";
@import "settings/variables";
@import "settings/mmenu-js-variables";


// 2. Tools are globally used mixins and functions. 
// It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
// @import "tools/xxx";


// 3. Generic - reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. 
// This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
// @import "generic/normalize";


// 4. Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). 
// These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here. 
@import "elements/html";
@import "elements/a";
@import "elements/h";


// 5. Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, 
// for example media object known from OOCSS

// 6. Blocks (aka Components) – specific UI components. 
// This is where the majority of our work takes place 
// and our UI components are often composed of Objects and Components.

// 7. Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything 
// which goes before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class.
